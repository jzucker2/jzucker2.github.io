title: Kirk Douglas

Kirk Douglas died today at 103 years old! Wow. And what an incredible career. He played a major role in ending the blacklist by requiring the studio to publicly credit blacklisted (and twice Oscar winner through false fronts during the 1950's) on Kubrick's Spartacus. This was portrayed in the great biopic [Trumbo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3203606), released a few years ago.

Back to the topic at hand, great Kirk Douglas films:

1. Spartacus (1960)
2. Ace in the Hole (1951) This movie was Billy Wilder's first commercial and critical flop. It was disliked because it depicted a reporter who was unscrupulous.
3. Paths of Glory (1957)
4. The Bad and the Beautiful (1952)
5. Out of the Past (1947) One of, if not _the_, greatest noirs of all time. This was Douglas's breakout film, with him playing the bad guy against Mitchum's anti-hero. Douglas lights up the screen. It's like he emerges fully formed, with all the bravado he exhibited in his class screen persona for decades after.
