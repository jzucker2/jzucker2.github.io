### Introduction

I found [this BFI list](https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/30-best-lgbt-films-all-time) which is helpful and want to expand on this subject from here.

### Movies I've Seen

Without further ado, here is my list so far, in no particular order, of great films related to LGBTQ themes:

1. Call me by your name
2. The Servant
3. Tangerine
4. The birdcage
5. Harvey Milk
6. Beauty and the beast (1945, cocteau) - [Notes here about it's themes of sexuality.](http://www.newnownext.com/beauty-and-the-beast-gay-cocteau/03/2017/) This movie is incredibly beautiful. The writer/director and the star were an openly gay power couple in 1940s Nazi-occupied France.

### Movies I haven't seen yet

Haven't seen:

1. Querelle
2. Fox and his friends

### Hitchcock

This is just fascinating. [Gay coding in Hitchcock's films.](https://www.us.mensa.org/read/bulletin/features/gay-coding-in-hitchcock-films/) I mentioned North by Northwest above, but didn't know about most of these other references.

### Movies with gay bad guys

Side note, gay characters as bad guys. There's definitely an interesting and likely prejudice to this theme, I wanted to try and bring it out in a concise manner.

List below:

1. Diamonds are Forever : the two henchmen are a clearly implied couple and are sociopathic
2. North by Northwest - Martin Landau plays the main henchman to James Mason's evil villain and there is absolutely a homosexual undertone to his malevolent character.
3. The servant - Dirk Bogarde's character uses sexuality as a weapon against the James Fox character
4. The Maltese Falcon - Cairo is gay. You can tell by the way he strokes his cane in his introductory scene. It's likely why Bogart never is afraid of him. In the book he is openly in a relationship with the boy, Wilmer, played by Elisha Cook.
5. Un flic (melville) - the informant is transexual and that turns into a minor character moment for Alain Delon
