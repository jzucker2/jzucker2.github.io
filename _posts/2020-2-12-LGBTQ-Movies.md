I found [this BFI list](https://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/features/30-best-lgbt-films-all-time) which is helpful and want to expand on this subject from here.

Without further ado, here is my list so far, in no particular order, of great films related to LGBTQ themes:

1. Call me by your name
2. The Servant
3. Tangerine
4. The birdcage
5. Harvey Milk

Haven't seen:

1. Querelle
2. Fox and his friends
3. My beautiful laundrette
4. Happy together
5. Tropical Maladay
6. Brokeback mountain
7. Weekend (2011)
8. Carol
9. All about my mother
10. my own private idaho
11. un chant d'amour
12. the bitter tears of petra von kant
13. blue is the warmest colour
14. 24 hour party people
15. But i'm a cheerleader

---

Side note, gay characters as bad guys. There's definitely an interesting and likely prejudice to this theme, I wanted to try and bring it out in a concise manner.

List below:

1. Diamonds are Forever : the two henchmen are a clearly implied couple and are sociopathic
2. North by Northwest - Martin Landau plays the main henchman to James Mason's evil villain and there is absolutely a homosexual undertone to his malevolent character.
3. The servant - Dirk Bogarde's character uses sexuality as a weapon against the James Fox character
