title: The Big Blank Noir Films
---

This is a derivative of my previous noir post. There's something about the genre that draws filmmakers to name their noir films The Big _____. This is a list of all those that I've discovered so far:

1. The Big Sleep (Hawks) - By far the best
2. The Big Knife (Aldrich)
3. The Big Steal
4. The Big Clock
5. The Big Lebowski
6. The Big Combo
7. Ace in the Hole (released as The Big Carnival)
8. The Big Heat
