1. _8.5_ (Fellini)
2. The Bicycle Thieves (de Sica)
3. Umberto D (de Sica)
4. La Dolce Vita (Fellini)
5. Big deal on madonna street (monicelli) - This movie has been remade many times including Crackers (Malle in 1984) and Welcome to Collinwood (Russo brothers debut in 2002)
6. Blow up (antonioni)
7. L'Avventura (antonioni)
8. Rome, Open City (Rossellini) - so incredibly powerful and moving
