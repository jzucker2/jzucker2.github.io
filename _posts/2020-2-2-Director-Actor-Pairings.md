title: Great Director/Actor Pairings
---

This is such an interesting phenomenon to me. There are some amazing pairings of directors and actors that lead to very prolific catalogs of movies.

There's [a wikipedia page for director/actor pairings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_film_director_and_actor_collaborations) and this post is by no means meant to be complete. It's a way for me to organize and explore this subject.

* Aldrich/Lancaster

* Scorsese/De Niro

Probably the most famous such pairing, their list of films is prolific:

1. Taxi Driver
2. New York, New York (never seen)
3. The King of Comedy
4. Cape Fear (never seen)
5. Goodfellas
6. Raging Bull
7. The Irishman
8. Casino

* Scorsese/DiCaprio

1. Gangs of New York - I happened to be obsessed with this movie as a kid. A great, Oscar winning (I believe?) performance by Daniel Day-Lewis in here too
2. The Aviator
3. Shutter Island
4. Wolf of Wall Street
5. The Departed

* Lucas/Harrison Ford

This is a weird one. Ford was never Lucas's first pick and he went to lengths to avoid casting him as Indy to not be a Scorsese/De Niro sort of thing. Tom Selleck was supposed to play Indiana Jones but was unable to get out of contract.

1. American Graffiti
2. Apocalypse Now (Lucas was supposed to direct but ended up producing instead)
3. Star Wars
4. Indiana Jones

* Paul Thomas Anderson/Daniel Day-Lewis

1. There Will Be Blood
2. Phantom Thread

* Fincher/Pitt

1. Se7en
2. Fight Club
3. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (never seen)

* Malcom McDowell/Lindsay Anderson

1. If...

* Linklater/Hawke

1. Before trilogy
2. Boyhood

* Burton/Depp

1. Edward Scissorhands
2. Ed Wood
3. Sweeney Todd (haven't seen)
4. Dark Shadows

* Tony Scott/Denzel Washington

1. The taking of pelham 123 (haven't seen)
2. Deja Vu
3. Man on Fire (haven't seen)
4. Unstoppable

* David O. Russell/Mark Wahlberg

1. I Heart Huckabees
